Hey, thank you for visiting my site. This is where i put my favorite photos that I already captured anywhere. I always love taking photos of the cities that i visit and try to stay longer. It's the best feeling to strolling around and feel the city atmosphere.

Ha! Sorry I forgot to introduce myself. I am Syarifah Riefandania or you can call me Rifie. Born and raised in South Jakarta, Indonesia and live with my beloved daughter and husband.

~~Now I am [on a break](https://rifie.com/post/183833014808/thank-you-olx-indonesia) and~~ it might be good to build something that i want and collect any of my photos in one site and hopefully you enjoy all the photos that I've been taken. I know it takes time but I am working on it. I also always want to write a blog about photography and this blog is my playground to write (hopefully) interesting content ;)
