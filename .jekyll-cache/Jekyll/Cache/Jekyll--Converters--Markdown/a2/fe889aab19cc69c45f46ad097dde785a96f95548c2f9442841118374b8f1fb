<p>Hey, thank you for visiting my site. This is where i put my favorite photos that I already captured anywhere. I always love taking photos of the cities that i visit and try to stay longer. It’s the best feeling to strolling around and feel the city atmosphere.</p>

<p>Ha! Sorry I forgot to introduce myself. I am Syarifah Riefandania or you can call me Rifie. Born and raised in South Jakarta, Indonesia and live with my beloved daughter and husband.</p>

<p><del>Now I am <a href="https://rifie.com/post/183833014808/thank-you-olx-indonesia">on a break</a> and</del> it might be good to build something that i want and collect any of my photos in one site and hopefully you enjoy all the photos that I’ve been taken. I know it takes time but I am working on it. I also always want to write a blog about photography and this blog is my playground to write (hopefully) interesting content ;)</p>
