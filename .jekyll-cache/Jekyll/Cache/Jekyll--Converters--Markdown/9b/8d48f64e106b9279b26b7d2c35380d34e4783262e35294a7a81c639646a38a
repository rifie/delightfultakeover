<p>Brave myself to buy mirrorless camera and I choose <a href="https://www.sony.co.id/en/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7m2-body-kit#product_details_default">Sony Alpha a7II.</a> Best decision so far!</p>

<h3 id="the-reason-why">The Reason Whyâ€¦</h3>

<p>Choosing Sony as my main camera was hard since I was a vivid Canon and Fujifilm customer and fell in love with both since i can remember. Then, we entered the mirrorless age and read how potential Sony as a contender in the market, see the results of the photo that captured by Sony, I think it worth to try to change my camera.</p>

<p>So couple months ago, I jumped into Sony Alpha A7II as my main camera! I knew it this camera is literally 5 years old, however since the price range is really way off my budget for getting the a7III or all the latest Alpha series, I told myself to maximise all the feature here and really suit my need.</p>

<p>Let me try to review it on my own perspective and how this camera works and help me to take photos and videos. You can always comments below!</p>

<h3 id="how-this-camera-solves-my-problem">How This Camera Solves My Problem?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It had me on Image Stabilisation.</strong> This one for me is the most important one to choose this camera. Sometimes, I can be very active or canâ€™t hold my hand steady for taking picture, this feature helps me to get the blurry photo reduced.</li>
  <li><strong>Offered high ISO.</strong> One of the best thing is Sony a7II offered high ISO to 25600! With this size, we can shoot with very low of lights.</li>
  <li><strong>Burst mode is great!</strong> Something that always do, 1 shot is never enough.</li>
  <li><strong>24MP of image resolution.</strong> This is new for me, going full-frame and try new stuff to capture great photos.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anything-that-i-dont-like">Anything that I donâ€™t like?</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The battery power is not that long</strong> I feel that the battery power is reducing fast, kinda bit annoying if I need to charge it often.</li>
  <li><strong>Confusing control</strong> I know I am new in this Sony world but itâ€™s really takes time to adjust with all the buttons in the camera.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>

<p>Sony Alpha a7II is great camera to explore with the unique offering of stabilisation feature. Great build quality and awesome performance.</p>
